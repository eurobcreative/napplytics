# napplytics
NApplytics performs measurements of multiple actions to recommend the best configuration options, and so we can apply this configuration in our smartphone. This App uses Mobilyzer library to calculate network speed.

For the HTTP action, we have three configuration options: HTTP 1.1, HTTP 1.1 TLS and HTTP 2. In this case, we need the speed value, the RSSI value and the RSRP value, and then the App calculates three Satisfaction Indexes (SI) and it displays the option with the best SI.

Soon, we will increase the number of measurement options.
